  <h1>For The Love Of Ruby</h1>
<p class="meta">17 Apr 2010 &#8211; Along Way From Home</p>
<p>Well, I am sick and tired of WordPress. Really I am sick of the whole mess that is <span class="caps">PHP</span> land. A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, I was a software developer for about 18 years &#8211; accidently. You see I went to school for Physics and Math and chucked in a CompSci major for the fun of it then accidently spent 18 years screwing around with computer crap. Then I sort of semi-retired and did the commercial photography thing &#8211; then I got sick of it when it felt just like.</p>
<p>Anyway here we are. Every time I mess around with my site I have to fix somebody&#8217;s crappy <span class="caps">PHP</span> code. The issue is some of the stuff I want to get done with it leaves me&#8230; dreading looking at the mess of fork-lift reuse and horrendously bad crap that is WordPress plug-in&#8217;s, themes, etc, etc. I really wouldn&#8217;t mind if it was even remotely elegant, clever, cool&#8230; pretty but it is not. When I came across this stuff in my professional life I &#8220;refactored&#8221; it &#8211; a nice way of saying ditch it and start over. The problem is that I really do not want to write software any more &#8211; if I did I would. The pay is fantastic. Now I enjoy fooling around with a few things here and there for pure recreation. When doing that I will only use the tools I actually love to use. I can write C in my sleep and as long as any code that touches mine is fantastically good I don&#8217;t mind that. Forget C++, not because it is bad &#8211; it is just the majority of the frameworks blow and again it is a hopeless mess done mostly by people that have not a clue. Cutting to the chase the two things I am willing to mess with at this point are Obj-C (just for the cool Cocoa frameworks so I can mess with new Apple stuff and my real love &#8211; Ruby.</p>
<p>Not that Ruby is a holy grail or anything &#8211; it is just the community is sooooo.. much different. It seems that language, and all of the frameworks, and conventions, and tools were brought into existence by software developers &#8211; real ones. Where <span class="caps">PHP</span> and the world around it seems to be the creation of VB knuckle heads and a few McDonalds fry cooks that hacked around in a Wordpress theme for a couple of weeks to get it to work. So&#8230; I think I might abandon Wordpress, the entire reason I use it is that I didn&#8217;t want any &#8220;computer work&#8221; while publishing my little blog. Trying to navigate that WordPress plug-in mess to find things that actually work and work the way I want them to is a nightmare. If I am going to have to screw with this stuff for more than 10 minutes then I may as well just do it myself &#8211; or at least the parts that I want to.</p>
<p>Here is my rediculously quick and dirty &#8220;conversion&#8221; of the old site with virtually no work. Behind the scenes there is a lot going on here, I just didn&#8217;t feel like dealling with the <span class="caps">CSS</span> for the other stuff yet. The really cool part is I actually wrote a custom WordPress converter in <span class="caps">IRB</span> that took 5 minutes with DataMapper and then grabbed a copy of the source of <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and coverted it to use <span class="caps">HAML</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">SASS</span> so I wouldn&#8217;t have to blow my brains out closing <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags. Heck I use <span class="caps">HAML</span>/<span class="caps">SASS</span> to create any <span class="caps">HTML</span> or <span class="caps">CSS</span> that I have to do vs getting some sort of repetitive motion injuries from all the &lt;/screw you&gt; nonsence.</p>
<p>The other really nice thing is that I can either host it statcally as I am doing over on <a href="http://rwboyer.github.com/">GitHub</a> or I can do it dynamically. The best part is for all the parts that need to be dynamic &#8211; as in server side code &#8211; I can just write them as lightweight web services with <span class="caps">RACK</span>/Sinatra. <br />
Yes I think I am done with the whole <span class="caps">PHP</span>/Wordpress shitty ass mess.</p>
