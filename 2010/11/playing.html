  <h1>Playing With Technology</h1>
<p class="meta">15 Nov 2010 &#8211; VM/370, MySQL Cluster, Vagrant, VBox, Rails3, <span class="caps">RVM</span></p>
<p>Been playing around a lot with tech lately. Somehow I re-embroiled myself in implementing some solutions for a couple of small businesses over the last couple years. I guess it started with a friend that needed to recover an ancient intel/unix system from a crashed drive&#8230; So guess who was the only person in a large radius that had a clue?</p>
<p>Moving on&#8230; the great thing about open source is not that not much of it isreally &#8220;new&#8221;, heck I was doing half this stuff (conceptually) in the late 80&#8217;s on big iron. The more things change the more they are the same. The great thing is how cheap &#8220;big business solutions&#8221; are for small business. That and some of the tools are pretty amazing in terms of convenience. Vagrant/Chef has to be the best thing since sliced bread.</p>
<p>All of this playing around got me thinking. Why is it that some platforms/languages/tools generate so much devotion and some don&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t mean popularity or market penetration, I mean that almost all the users of of <em>some</em> platforms/languages/tools are extreme Zelots vs. mere fans or users.</p>
<p>Multics, VM/<span class="caps">CMS</span>, Unix, C, emacs, and a few others seem to stick out as the former. I predict that ruby may become one of those few that have a Zelot like following even after it&#8217;s time has passed and it&#8217;s not &#8220;new&#8221; anymore. Who knows but I have the same feeling about it as I did for some of my other fond tech memories. We&#8217;ll see. Thinkng about some of the good ones got me so teary eyed that I fired up VM/370 over the weekend on <a href="http://www.hercules-390.org/">hercules</a> regen&#8217;d it and then got <span class="caps">MVS</span>/<span class="caps">TSO</span>, <span class="caps">MVT</span>, and a new gen of VM all running under it as virtual machines. Amazing. I even remember alot of 370 assembler. My Core i5 Macbook Pro sure blows the ol&#8217; 3083 into the weeds. It is amazing how efficient the big iron code is even in an emulator. I think the <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PP3083.html">3083</a> is the first machine I worked on &#8211; that and a <a href="http://jack.hoaroots.org/b5900.htm">Burroughs B6900</a></p>
<p>More later.</p>
