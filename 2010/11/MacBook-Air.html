  <h1>Brand New MacBook Air</h1>
<p class="meta">18 Nov 2010 &#8211; My Rationale For A Really Expensive 11.6&quot; Air</p>
<p>Normal people try to get the best quatifiable bang for their buck. Normal people that are willing to slam down $1400 in hard earned cash for a new MacBook Air no doubt end up getting the 13&quot;. I mean who the crap would spend that much on the 11.6 inch model? You would have to be out of your mind. Wouldn&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Come on, the 13 has a better, bigger screen. It has a faster processor no matter how you slice it. It has a better, longer lasting battery. It has the same 4Gig of memory for the same dinero. Let&#8217;s see &#8211; better &#8211; better &#8211; better. I&#8217;ll take the less better one please. Yep, I maxed out everything on the 11.6 incher and it priced out pretty much the same as a better spec&#8217;d 13.3.</p>
<p>You might say <span class="caps">WTF</span> &#8211; right. Maybe you are facing the same set of decisions and your highly trained auto reaction is to hit the buy button on the one that is &quot;better. Here is some food for thought for you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Both 11.6 and 13.3 are too too small to do &#8220;big screen&#8221; kind of work on where you need a ton of info blasted at you at the same time. This is the realm of 15&quot;HD minium (if you like to squint to see the tiny stuff). I got that in my top of the line 15&quot; <span class="caps">MBP</span>. Okay so you don&#8217;t have one of those like me. And you also don&#8217;t have a MacPro w/ 2&#215;27&#8243; Cinemas like me. Great &#8211; get a 27&quot; with a wireless keyboard and mouse for &#8220;big&#8221; work. Both of the MBA&#8217;s will drive it fine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Back on point &#8211; I am going to write and code on this thing while I am actually portable. I mean really portable. Make mine the small. When I write and/or code, activities that suck down a lot of my time, I <em>live</em> in Terminal.app or full screen wordprocessor of the day (Pages, WriteRoom, Scrivener, etc.) These apps look great fullscreen on either MacBook Air. The look stupid in fullscreen HD+. Well at least they look stupid when you are in type the text mode.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>For my real work pattern of work &#8211; close lid &#8211; think &#8211; open &#8211; type &#8211; close lid. The 11.6 batter will go all day. That&#8217;s good enough for me.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>1.6Ghz C2D vs 1.83Ghz &#8211; for writing/codeing heck even compiling &#8211; as we all know unless you are rebuilding all of <span class="caps">GNU</span> over and over &#8211; anything you can buy (except and Atom) is too too fast to even catch a smoke and think before the build is done.</li>
</ul>
<p>My MacBook Air intent is small and focused. I want the smallest and mosted focused device. So why did I max it out. Ummmm now that I think about it, maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have. Ahh what the heck &#8211; 128G is not that much storage &#8211; I do like my HD. And you just gotta have 4G so you can fire up a couple of server images using Vagrant to test on, etc. Oh and I gotta run Aperture in a pinch without out growing old.</p>
<p>Good luck with your decisions &#8211; I waffled on this since the annoucement and finally did the deed today.</p>
